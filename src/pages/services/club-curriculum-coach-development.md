Knowledge integration takes time, energy, varied activities and many opportunities to make connections from one topic to another. We believe there are four components to long term learning:

1. Guidance
2. Quality Instruction
3. Goal Setting
4. Self Reflection – Feedback

Our goal is to empower sport leaders to develop a clear vision of how to approach student-athlete development that is in line with the core values and beliefs of it’s organization and helps achieve it’s overall mission and philosophy.

Our key areas of focus:

1. Curriculum Development – Teaching methods
2. Coach Development – Mentorship and feedback
3. Clinics – Player and Coach
