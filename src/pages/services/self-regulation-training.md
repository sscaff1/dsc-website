title: Self regulation training
---
Youth Sport Programs have been recognized to have positive impact on youth development through helping young athletes to learn about themselves and to develop life skills.  These may include physical (e.g., healthy diet), behavioral (e.g., goal setting) or cognitive (e.g., self-talk).  

Many of these skills necessary to succeed in sport are transferable to other life contexts, including problem solving, time management, goal setting, coping with failures and performing under pressure.  

Our goal is to tailor a personal approach for each student-athlete to develop and incorporate self-regulation skills into their day-to-day lives on and off the field.
