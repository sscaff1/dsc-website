    title: Self Regulation Coach
services:
  - description: "Players are guided on effective processes to analyze match film at the team and individual level.  These workflows will improve the players ability to recognize key player behaviors, significant tactical trends and strategies of an opponent.  \r\n\n\n\nAdditionally, players will gain critical feedback on key areas for individual improvement.  With this knowledge our coaches will take the time to guide players in creating a concrete action plan and consistent monitoring system in order to improve these areas throughout the developmental phases of a youth athlete."
    title: Individual athlete development game analysis and action plan
  - description: "Youth Sport Programs have been recognized to have positive impact on youth development through helping young athletes to learn about themselves and to develop life skills.  These may include physical (e.g., healthy diet), behavioral (e.g., goal setting) or cognitive (e.g., self-talk).  \r\n\n\r\n\nMany of these skills necessary to succeed in sport are transferable to other life contexts, including problem solving, time management, goal setting, coping with failures and performing under pressure.  \r\n\n\r\n\nOur goal is to tailor a personal approach for each student-athlete to develop and incorporate self-regulation skills into their day-to-day lives on and off the field."
    title: Self regulation training

We believe there are four components to long term learning:\r\n\n\r\n\nGuidance\r\n\n1. Quality Instruction\r\n2. Goal Setting\r\n3. Self Reflection – Feedback\r\n\n\r\n\nOur goal is to empower sport leaders to develop a clear vision of how to approach student-athlete development that is in line with the core values and beliefs of it’s organization and helps achieve it’s overall mission and philosophy.  \r\n\n\r\n\nOur key areas of focus:\r\n\n1. Curriculum Development – Teaching methods \r\n2. Coach Development – Mentorship and feedback\r\n3. Clinics – Player and Coach"
